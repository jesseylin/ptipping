# TODO list

- [ ] Code basic ODEs in Julia
- [ ] Reproduce classical bifurcation diagram
- [ ] Compute basins of attraction (numerically)/ptipping diagram

# Outline of talk

Part 1

- explain model
- show normal bifurcation diagram
- but, this doesn't explain all of it...
- explain p-tipping

Part 2

- explain partial basin instability
- calculation of area which is basin unstable
